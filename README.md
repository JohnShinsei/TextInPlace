## Research Fork Roadmap

This fork is used for graduation-research experiments on improving TextInPlace. Planned updates include reproducible baseline evaluation, confidence-aware fuzzy text reranking, LLM-free discriminative text selection, evaluation caching, failure-case analysis, and paper-aware baseline review.

See [Planned Optimization Directions](docs/planned_updates.md) for details.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a crucial capability for long-term autonomous robots, enabling them to identify previously visited locations using visual information. 
However, existing methods remain limited in indoor settings due to the highly repetitive structures inherent in such environments. 
We observe that scene text typically appears in indoor spaces, serving to distinguish visually similar but different places. 
This inspires us to propose TextInPlace, a simple yet effective VPR framework that integrates Scene Text Spotting (STS) to mitigate visual perceptual ambiguity in repetitive indoor environments. 
Specifically, TextInPlace adopts a dual-branch architecture within a local parameter sharing network. The VPR branch employs attention-based aggregation to extract global descriptors for coarse-grained retrieval, while the STS branch utilizes a bridging text spotter to detect and recognize scene text. 
Finally, the discriminative text is filtered to compute text similarity and re-rank the top-K retrieved images. 
To bridge the gap between current text-based repetitive indoor scene datasets and the typical scenarios encountered in robot navigation, we establish an indoor VPR benchmark dataset, called Maze-with-Text. 
Extensive experiments on both custom and public datasets demonstrate that TextInPlace achieves superior performance over existing methods that rely solely on appearance information.

## Usage

#### Environment Setup

You can create your own conda environment for TextInPlace based on the following command⚙️:

```bash
conda create -n stloc python=3.10 -y
conda activate stloc
pip install torch==2.2.0+cu121 torchvision==0.17.0+cu121 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
cd detectron2
pip install -e . && cd ..
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py build develop
```

#### Maze-with-Text Dataset

To bridge the gap between current text-based repetitive indoor scene datasets and the typical scenarios encountered in robot navigation, we establish an indoor VPR benchmark dataset, called Maze-with-Text. The number of images in the Maze-with-Text dataset is as follows：

| **Floor** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | All |
|:----------------:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:--:|:--:|
| **Queries**   | 280 | 253 | 258 | 245 | 269 | 1305 |
| **Database**  | 1368 | 2268 | 1588 | 1720 | 1596 | 8540 |

You can download Maze-with-Text dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RtW7x9VLyzHIzaMACI2YtP4KVpXkwf1r/view?usp=sharing). 
After downloading, please unzip the archive and organize the dataset into the following directory structure:

```
|-- Maze-with-Text
    |-- images
        |-- test
            |-- database
            |   |-- @-00.0027@038.6324@5@339@0@.jpg
                ...
            |-- queries
            |   |-- @-00.0012@032.7272@5@65@3@.jpg
                ...
```

#### Evaluation

Evaluation script

```shell
python -W ignore eval.py --backbone ResNet50 --aggregation boq \
  --features_dim 16384 \
  --infer_batch_size 64 \
  --config-file configs/Bridge/TotalText/R_50_poly.yaml \
  --dataset_name Maze-with-Text \
  --datasets_folder <Path with all datasets> \
  --resume <Path with the checkpoint>
```

Before running the evaluation script, please follow the steps below.

- **Download Checkpoint**: Get the [checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fJaaLta9mJfOwALjMg63c8oXNpm3Y_Q0/view?usp=drive_link) file.

- **File Placement**: Move the downloaded checkpoint file to the designated path: `./checkpoints/`.

(Optional) If you want to use an LLM for text-based reranking, please set your own API key in [utils/test.py](https://github.com/HqiTao/TextInPlace/blob/main/utils/test.py#L209-L210) and add `--use_llm` flag at the end of the command.

#### Training

TextInPlace needs to train its VPR branch, while its STS branch is adopted from [Bridging-Text-Spotting](https://github.com/mxin262/Bridging-Text-Spotting).
We employ a two-phase training strategy, beginning with training on a large-scale outdoor data and subsequently fine-tuning it using indoor data.

Training script

```shell
Bash train.sh
```

Before running the training script, please follow the steps below.


- **Download Checkpoint**: Get the [checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15GnzJx_Cd0gKHGUzam5zcEFiPwbBOT-D/view?usp=sharing) of the STS branch, and place it in the designated path: `./checkpoints/pretrain/BTS`.

- **Dataset Preparation**: 
1. Download [GSV-Cities](https://github.com/amaralibey/gsv-cities) dataset in the [datasets_folder](https://github.com/HqiTao/TextInPlace/blob/main/utils/parser.py#L107).
